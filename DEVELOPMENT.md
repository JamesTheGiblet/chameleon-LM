The Chameleon LM Strategic Roadmap

Phase 0: Foundation & Research (Q4 2025: Approx. 4 Weeks)

Goal: To establish a rock-solid foundation for development by deeply understanding the user and the technical landscape. We build nothing yet. We plan, research, and design.

    Key Initiatives:

        User Discovery & Validation:

            Engage with the "HR Talent Scout" contacts on LinkedIn.

            Conduct interviews to map their exact workflow, identify their biggest pain points in screening, and define what a "magical" solution would look like to them.

            Flesh out the user persona for the HR Talent Scout.

        Technical Architecture & Scoping:

            Evaluate potential foundational LLMs (e.g., offerings from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, open-source models). Assess them based on capability, cost, speed, and privacy.

            Research high-level approaches for the "Dynamic Configuration Engine" (e.g., advanced prompt chaining, RAG, PEFT).

            Design a high-level system architecture diagram.

        UX/UI Wireframing:

            Design the low-fidelity user flow for the PoC: the initial dialogue, the resume submission, and the results screen. Focus purely on clarity and simplicity.

    Deliverable: A Project Specification Document that includes validated user needs, a high-level technical plan, and core UX wireframes.

Phase 1: Proof of Concept (PoC) - "The HR Scout" (End of Q4 2025 - Q1 2026: Approx. 8 Weeks)

Goal: To build a functional, internal prototype that validates our core thesis: conversational configuration can create a genuinely useful domain expert.

    Key Initiatives:

        Develop Core Engine (v0.1):

            Build the backend logic for the "Dynamic Configuration Engine."

            Implement the conversational flow based on the Phase 0 wireframes.

        Implement HR Scout Functionality:

            Create the mechanism to ingest resumes (e.g., simple text paste).

            Develop the analysis module that compares resumes against the configured criteria.

            Generate the ranked list and summary output.

        Build Internal Tooling:

            Create a barebones, password-protected web interface for internal testing and for our beta group. No polish, purely functional.

        Execute Beta Test:

            Onboard the friendly HR scouts from LinkedIn.

            Gather structured feedback on the PoC's effectiveness and usability.

    *Key Feature explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this phase: The AI-generated content detection score.

    Deliverable: A functional prototype and a Beta Feedback Report summarizing whether we successfully demonstrated the "magic moment."

Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - "The Chameleon Toolkit" (Q2 2026)

Goal: To evolve the successful PoC into a stable, polished product for a broader, invite-only audience and introduce our first key feature enhancement.

    Key Initiatives:

        Incorporate PoC Feedback:

            Refine the configuration dialogue and the analysis output based on the Beta Feedback Report.

        Feature Enhancement: AI Detection Score:

            Integrate the 0-100 risk score for AI-generated content into the resume analysis.

        Develop the pip install Package:

            Begin building the core logic into an installable Python library, as envisioned in the original concept.

        Build a Scalable Web Application:

            Develop a proper frontend with user account management (sign-up, login).

            Choose and implement a scalable backend framework and database solution.

            Establish a cloud hosting environment.

    Deliverable: A closed, invite-only web application (our MVP) ready for early adopters.

Phase 3: Open Beta & Domain Expansion (Q3 2026)

Goal: To stress-test the system with a public audience and prove the model can successfully "become" an expert in a second domain.

    Key Initiatives:

        Public Launch:

            Open the platform for public sign-ups.

        Introduce a Second Domain:

            Implement the "Sales Deal Analyst" as a second configurable expert. This is a critical test of the platform's core premise.

        Establish Analytics & Monitoring:

            Integrate product analytics to understand user behaviour.

            Set up system monitoring to ensure reliability and performance.

        Build a Community:

            Create a space (e.g., Discord, forum) for users to share feedback and suggest new domains.

    Deliverable: A live, public product with at least two domains, a growing user base, and a steady stream of feedback.

Phase 4: Commercialization & Enterprise Readiness (Q4 2026 and beyond)

Goal: To introduce monetization and build the features necessary to sell to business customers.

    Key Initiatives:

        Introduce Pricing Tiers:

            Define and implement subscription plans (e.g., Free, Pro, Business).

        Develop Enterprise Features:

            Build "Multi-Role Team Configuration."

            Implement enterprise-grade security features (e.g., SSO, audit logs).

        Cross-Domain Intelligence:

            Develop the advanced feature of correlating insights across different configured experts.

        Scale Sales & Marketing:

            Formalize a go-to-market strategy to actively pursue enterprise clients.

    Deliverable: A mature SaaS platform with a clear revenue stream and a defined enterprise sales motion.
